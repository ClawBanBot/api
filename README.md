# Welcome to the Claw Ban Bot

## Getting started with development

## Claw Ban Bot Front-End

This respository is designed to work in parallel with the [Claw Ban Bot Front-End](https://github.com/ClawBanBot/clawbanbot-fe).

## Pre requisites

```text
yarn OR npm
Docker
```

## Environment variables

Add a `.env` file to the root of the project and configure your environment variables.

An example `.env` file has been included for you. 

The Twitch Client Id and Secret can be generated by creating a new application [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).

The Content Moderator Key and Content Moderator Endpoint are from Azure, given to you when you create a Content Moderator resource in the Azure Portal. For instructions on how to get started, visit the [Microsoft Docs Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/content-moderator/client-libraries?tabs=visual-studio&pivots=programming-language-csharp) which includes a link to create a resource and generate those values.

## Getting Started

After ensuring you have the pre-requisites downloaded and your .env file created with the values added, it is time to run the API! We assume yarn here but change to npm if that is your tool of choice.

```bash
yarn install
```

This grabs the dependencies as listed in the package.json file.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This spins up the Docker containing with all the API running inside. Voila!

*Note: This will only spin up the backend so you will not have any sites running. This is where the front-end project comes in.
